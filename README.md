# **M**ulti-**O**mics **NET**work inference (MONET)

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

We developed a novel Bayesian nonparametric regression approach called
Multi-Omics NETwork inference (MONET) for high-dimensionality
multi-modal data integration in order to quantify the temporally
dependent forces driving development and to distinguish these from those
induced by perturbation effects. Statistical inference is performed in a
Bayesian setting using `rstan` an implementation in `R` of `STAN` (a
probabilistic programming language for statistical inference).

## Installation

Currently you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anasrana/monet")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(monet)
## basic example code
```
