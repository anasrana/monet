Description: We developed a novel Bayesian nonparametric regression approach called Multi-Omics NETwork inference (MONET) for high-dimensionality multi-modal data integration in order to quantify the temporally dependent forces driving development and to distinguish these from those induced by perturbation effects. Statistical inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using `rstan` an implementation in `R` of `STAN` (a probabilistic programming language for statistical inference).
